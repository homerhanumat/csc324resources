In this assignment you add some buttons to the table you created and populated in a previous assignment.  You will practice handling events in JavaScript.

In order to prepare for this exercise, read Chapter 15 of *Eloquent JavaScript*.

Starting from the site that populates a table of Bhangra artists, add three buttons:

* a button that when clicked will sort the artists by name;
* a button that when clicked will sort the artists by year of birth;
* a button that when clicked will randomly shuffle the rows of the original table.

The completed page with all of its assets should be wrapped in a folder with a name of the form <code>table-sort_firstname_lastname.zip</code>.  Zip this folder and email it to me.
