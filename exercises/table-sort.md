In this assignment you add some buttons to the table you created and populated in a previous assignment.  You will practice handling events in JavaScript.

In order to prepare for this exercise, read Chapter 15 of *Eloquent JavaScript*.  To learn about sorting, we will study <a href="/documents/table-sort-notes.js" download>this JavaScript file</a> in class.

Starting from the site that populates a table of Bhangra artists, add three buttons:

* a button that when clicked will sort the artists by name;
* a button that when clicked will sort the artists by year of birth;
* a button that when clicked will randomly shuffle the rows of the original table.

Make a folder in your CSC324 repository, called `table-sort`.  The completed page with all of its assets should be in this folder and should be pushed to the repository by the due-date.
