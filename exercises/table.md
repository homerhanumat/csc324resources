In this assignment you will use JavaScript in the browser to
select a table and fill it with information obtained from an
array of objects.  You'll get some practice with the DOM and with
iteration.

In order to prepare for this exercise, read Chapters 13 and 14 of *Eloquent JavaScript*.

As preparation in class, we will study the following:

* <a href="/documents/ch14_mountains.html" download>Populatiing a Table of Mountains</a>
* <a href="/documents/ch14_mountains-2.html" download>Populatiing a Table of Mountains (InnerHTML Approach)</a>
* <a href="/documents/ch14_mountains-3.html" download>Populatiing a Table of Mountains (with Hyperlinks)</a>

Download <a href="/documents/table-assign.zip">this zip-file</a> and extract it into your CSC 324 repo.  Note that the <code>custom.js</code> file defines an array called <code>artists</code>.  Complete the file with code that locates the
table on the index page and populates it with the information in <code>artists</code>.

 <figure>
  <img src="/images/bhangra-table.png" alt="bhangra artists table" style="width:70%; margin:  auto;">
  <figcaption>When the page is loaded and the browser has run the code in <code>custom.js</code>, the page should look like the image above.</figcaption>
</figure> 

Make a folder in your CSC324 repository, called `table-assign`.  The completed page with all of its assets should be in this folder and should be pushed to the repository by the due-date.
